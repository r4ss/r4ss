#' @param exe Executable name. Can be just the name of the executable
#' file if it is in the specified directory or in the user's PATH. Can
#' also include the absolute path or a path relative to the specified
#' directory. Needs to be a single character string, not a vector.
#' On Windows, `exe` can optionally have the `.exe` extension appended;
#' on Unix-based systems (i.e., Mac and Linux), no extension should be
#' included.
