}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{Vector of which plots to make (1 = data only, 2 = with fit).
If \code{plotdat = FALSE} then subplot 1 is not created, regardless of
choice of \code{subplots}.}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{fleets}{Optional vector to subset fleets for which plots will be made}

\item{fleetnames}{Optional replacement for fleenames used in data file}

\item{datplot}{Make data-only plot of discards? This can override the choice
of \code{subplots}.}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{yhi}{Maximum y-value which will always be included in the plot
(all data included regardless). Default = 1 so that discard fractions are always
plotted on a 0-1 range, but total discard amounts which are greater than this value
will exceed it.}

\item{ymax}{Optional maximum y-value to include (useful if upper tails on
discard amounts are very high)}

\item{col1}{First color to use in plot (for expected values)}

\item{col2}{Second color to use in plot (for observations and intervals)}

\item{pwidth}{Width of plot}

\item{pheight}{Height of plot}

\item{punits}{Units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles}

\item{verbose}{Report progress to R GUI?}
