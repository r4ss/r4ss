\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of x-values.}

\item{y}{Vector of y-values.}

\item{z}{Vector of bubble sizes, where positive sizes will be plotted as
closed bubbles and negative as open unless \code{allopen==TRUE}.}

\item{col}{Color for bubbles. Should be either a single value or vector
of length equal to x, y, and z vectors.}

\item{cexZ1}{Character expansion (cex) value for a proportion of 1.0.}

\item{maxsize}{Size of largest bubble. Preferred option is now an expansion
factor for a bubble with z=1 (see \code{cexZ1} above).}

\item{do.sqrt}{Should size be based on the area? (Diameter proportional to
sqrt(z)). Default=TRUE.}

\item{bg.open}{background color for open bubbles (border will equal 'col')}

\item{legend}{Add a legend?}

\item{legendloc}{Location of legend. Either a string like "topleft" or a
vector of two numeric values representing the fraction of the maximum in
the x and y dimensions, respectively. See \code{help("legend")} for more info on
the string options.}

\item{legend.z}{If a legend is added, what z values will be shown. Default
is c(-3,-2,-1,.1,1,2,3) for Pearson-like quantities and a smaller range for
proportions that are all less than 1.}

\item{legend.yadj}{If a legend is added, how much should the y-axis be
expanded to make space for it.}

\item{main}{Title of plot. Default="".}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles.
The default is \code{cex.main=1}.}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label.}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label.}

\item{minnbubble}{Minimum number of unique x values below which extra space
is added to horizontal axis (to make plot look better). Default = 8.}

\item{xlim}{Optional limits on x-range.}

\item{ylim}{Optional limits on y-range.}

\item{axis1}{Show the horizontal axis on plot? Option allows turning off for
use in multi-figure plots.}

\item{xlimextra}{Extra space (see minnbubble above). Default = 1.}

\item{add}{Add bubbles to existing plot? Default=FALSE.}

\item{las}{Style of axis labels (see ?par for more info).}

\item{allopen}{Should all bubbles be open (instead of just negative values)?}

\description{
Bubble plot based on function vaguely based on \code{bubble} by Edzer
Pebesma in gstat package. By default, positive values have closed bubbles
and negative values have open bubbles. Tmp change, do not merge this PR! Small change.
