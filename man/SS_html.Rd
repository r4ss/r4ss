\description{
Writes a set of HTML files with tabbed navigation between them.  Depends on
\code{\link{SS_plots}} with settings in place to write figures to PNG files.
Should open main file in default browser automatically.
}
\note{
By default, this function will look in the directory where PNG files
were created for CSV files with the name 'plotInfoTable...' written by
'SS_plots. HTML files are written to link to these plots and put in the same
directory. Please provide feedback on any bugs, annoyances, or suggestions
for improvement.
