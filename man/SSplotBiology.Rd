\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{add}{add to existing plot}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create
Numbering of subplots is as follows:
\itemize{
  \item 1 growth curve only
  \item 2    growth curve with CV and SD
  \item 3    growth curve with maturity and weight
  \item 4    distribution of length at age (still in development)
  \item 5    length or wtatage matrix
  \item 6    maturity
  \item 7    fecundity from model parameters
  \item 8    fecundity at weight from BIOLOGY section
  \item 9    fecundity at length from BIOLOGY section
  \item 10    spawning output at length
  \item 11    spawning output at age
  \item 21    Natural mortality (if age-dependent)
  \item 22    Time-varying growth persp
  \item 23    Time-varying growth contour
  \item 24    plot time-series of any time-varying quantities
  \item 31    hermaphroditism transition probability
  \item 32    hermaphroditism cumulative probability
}
Additional plots not created by default
\itemize{
  \item 101    diagram with labels showing female growth curve
  \item 102    diagram with labels showing female growth curve & male offsets
  \item 103    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) (offset type 2)
  \item 104    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) & male offset (type 2)
  \item 105    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) (offset type 3)
  \item 106    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) & male offset (type 3)
}}

\item{seas}{which season to plot (values other than 1 only work in
seasonal models but but maybe not fully implemented)}

\item{morphs}{Which morphs to plot (if more than 1 per sex)? By default this
will be replist[["mainmorphs"]]}

\item{forecast}{Include forecast years in plots of time-varying biology?}

\item{minyr}{optional input for minimum year to show in plots}

\item{maxyr}{optional input for maximum year to show in plots}

\item{colvec}{vector of length 3 with colors for various points/lines}

\item{ltyvec}{vector of length 2 with lty for females/males in growth plots
values can be applied to other plots in the future}

\item{shadealpha}{Transparency parameter used to make default shadecol
values (see ?rgb for more info)}

\item{imageplot_text}{Whether to add numerical text to the image plots
when using weight at age. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{imageplot_text_round}{The number of significant digits to which
the image plot text is rounded. Defaults to 0, meaning whole numbers. If
all your values are small and there's no contrast in the text, you might
want to make this 1 or 2.}

\item{legendloc}{Location of legend (see ?legend for more info)}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{pwidth}{Width of plot}

\item{pheight}{Height of plot}

\item{punits}{Units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles}

\item{mainTitle}{Logical indicating if a title should be included at the top}

\item{verbose}{Return updates of function progress to the R GUI?}
