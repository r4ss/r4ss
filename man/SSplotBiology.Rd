\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{add}{add to existing plot}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create
Numbering of subplots is as follows:
\itemize{
\item 1 growth curve only
\item 2    growth curve with CV and SD
\item 3    growth curve with maturity and weight
\item 4    distribution of length at age (still in development)
\item 5    length or wtatage matrix
\item 6    maturity
\item 7    fecundity from model parameters
\item 8    fecundity at weight from BIOLOGY section
\item 9    fecundity at length from BIOLOGY section
\item 10    spawning output at length
\item 11    spawning output at age
\item 21    Natural mortality (if age-dependent)
\item 22    Time-varying growth persp
\item 23    Time-varying growth contour
\item 24    plot time-series of any time-varying quantities (created if the
MGparm_By_Year_after_adjustments table (report:7) is available in the
Report.sso file)
\item 31    hermaphroditism transition probability
\item 32    sex ratio in ending year
(only plotted when model has hermaphroditism)
}
Additional plots not created by default
\itemize{
\item 101    diagram with labels showing female growth curve
\item 102    diagram with labels showing female growth curve & male offsets
\item 103    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) (offset type 2)
\item 104    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) & male offset (type 2)
\item 105    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) (offset type 3)
\item 106    diagram with labels showing female CV = f(A) & male offset (type 3)
}}

\item{seas}{which season to plot (values other than 1 only work in
seasonal models but but maybe not fully implemented)}

\item{morphs}{Which morphs to plot (if more than 1 per sex)? By default this
will be \code{replist[["mainmorphs"]]}}

\item{forecast}{Include forecast years in plots of time-varying biology?}

\item{minyr}{optional input for minimum year to show in plots}

\item{maxyr}{optional input for maximum year to show in plots}

\item{colvec}{vector of length 3 with colors for various points/lines}

\item{areacols}{Optional vector of colors for each area if model has
multiple areas. NULL value will be replaced by a default set of areas.}

\item{ltyvec}{vector of length 2 with lty for females/males in growth plots
values can be applied to other plots in the future}

\item{shadealpha}{Transparency parameter used to make default shadecol
values (see ?rgb for more info)}

\item{imageplot_text}{Whether to add numerical text to the image plots
when using weight at age. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{imageplot_text_round}{The number of significant digits to which
the image plot text is rounded. Defaults to 0, meaning whole numbers. If
all your values are small and there's no contrast in the text, you might
want to make this 1 or 2.}

\item{legendloc}{Location of legend. Either a string like "topleft" or a
vector of two numeric values representing the fraction of the maximum in
the x and y dimensions, respectively. See \code{help("legend")} for more info on
the string options.}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written.}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels).}

\item{pwidth}{Default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}.}

\item{pheight}{Height of plots printed to png files in units of \code{punits}.
Default is designed to allow two plots per page, with \code{pheight_tall} used
for plots that work best with a taller format and a single plot per page.}

\item{pheight_tall}{Height of tall plots printed to png files in units of
\code{punits}, where the tall plots are a subset of the plots which typically
work best in a taller format.}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), or "mm" (millimeters).
The default is \code{punits="in"}.}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see
\code{help("png")} in R for details).}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles.
The default is \code{cex.main=1}.}

\item{mainTitle}{Logical indicating if a title should be included at the top
(not yet implemented for all plots).}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}
