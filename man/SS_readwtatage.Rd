\title{Read in a weight-at-age data file as a data frame}
\usage{
SS_readwtatage(file = "wtatage.ss", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.

See the formal arguments for a possible default filename.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with a variable number of columns based on the
number of ages that are included in the file. Though, the first columns
will always be \code{year}, \code{seas}, \code{sex}, \code{bio_pattern}, \code{birthSeas}, and \code{fleet}.
The seventh column will be age zero.
The last or next to last column will be the maximum age included
in the weight-at-age data. For Stock Synthesis versions 3.30 and greater,
the last column will be a column of comments.

\code{NULL} is returned if \code{file} does not exist or if the file does exist but
it is empty. This behavior is different than other \verb{SS_read*} functions that
error if either of the previous checks are \code{TRUE}. Thus, a complicated check
involving \code{\link[=tryCatch]{tryCatch()}} is used around \code{\link[=readLines]{readLines()}} to allow for returning
\code{NULL} rather than \code{stop()}. Additionally, this check accommodates a URL
for \code{file}.
