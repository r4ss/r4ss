\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{infotable}{Optional table of information controlling appearance of
plot and legend. Is produced as output and can be modified and entered as
input.}

\item{fleets}{Optional vector to subset fleets for which to make plots}

\item{fleetnames}{Optional replacement for fleenames used in data file}

\item{sizefactors}{Which elements of the factors column of SIZE_SELEX should
be included in plot of selectivity across multiple fleets?}

\item{agefactors}{Which elements of the factors column of AGE_SELEX should
be included in plot of selectivity across multiple fleets?}

\item{years}{Which years for selectivity are shown in multi-line plot
(default = last year of model).}

\item{minyr}{optional input for minimum year to show in plots}

\item{maxyr}{optional input for maximum year to show in plots}

\item{season}{Which season (if seasonal model) for selectivity shown in
multi-line plot (default = 1).}

\item{sexes}{Optional vector to subset genders for which to make plots
(1=females, 2=males)}

\item{selexlines}{Vector to select which lines get plotted. values are 1.
Selectivity, 2. Retention, 3. Discard mortality, 4. Keep = Sel*Ret, 5. Dead
= Sel*(Ret+(1-Ret)*Mort).}

\item{subplot}{Vector controlling which subplots to create}

\item{skipAgeSelex10}{Exclude plots for age selectivity type 10 (selectivity
= 1.0 for all ages beginning at age 1)?}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{add}{Add to existing plot (not yet implemented)}

\item{labels}{vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{col1}{color for female growth curve}

\item{col2}{color for male growth curve}

\item{lwd}{Line widths for plots}

\item{spacepoints}{number of years between points shown on top of lines (for
long timeseries, points every year get mashed together)}

\item{staggerpoints}{number of years to stagger the first point (if
\code{spacepoints > 1}) for each line (so that adjacent lines have points in
different years)}

\item{legendloc}{location of legend. See ?legend for more info.}

\item{pwidth}{width of plot}

\item{pheight}{height of plot}

\item{punits}{units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion for plot titles}

\item{showmain}{Include main title at top of plot?}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written. By default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{verbose}{report progress to R GUI?}
