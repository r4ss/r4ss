\arguments{
\item{SSout}{The output from \code{\link{SS_output}}}

\item{yrs}{The vector of years to plot}

\item{ylimBar}{y-axis limits for catch barplot}

\item{ylimDepl}{y-axis limits for depletion line}

\item{colBar}{colors of the bars}

\item{cexBarLabels}{character expansion for the labels underneath the bars
(years)}

\item{cex.axis}{character expansion for the axis labels}

\item{space}{space between bars (see space argument of \code{barplot})}

\item{pchDepl}{character type for points on the depletion line}

\item{colDepl}{color of the points on the depletion line}

\item{lwdDepl}{width of the depletion line}

\item{shiftDepl}{shift from beginning of the year for the points on the
depletion line. Helps to guide the eye for exactly which year it corresponds
to.}

\item{pchSpace}{number of years between points on the depletion line. Higher
numbers help tidy up the plot when plotting many years.}

\item{ht}{Height of the plot in inches}

\item{wd}{Width of the plot in inches}

\item{labelLines}{line argument for \code{mtext} to move the axis labels}

\item{makePDF}{filename for a pdf file. If NULL it does not make a pdf.  Can
specify a pdf filename or a png filename. Not both at the same time.}

\item{makePNG}{filename for a png image. If NULL it does not make a png.
Can specify a pdf filename or a png filename. Not both at the same time.}

\item{MCMC}{If TRUE, will use mcmc results. It needs a list element called
'mcmc' on SSout.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the years, spawning biomass, depletion,
and total dead catch.
}
\description{
Creates a plot of catch and spawning biomass from the output of
\code{\link{SS_output}} for the NOAA TSC report.
}
\details{
It creates a plot on the current graphics device, in a pdf file, or as a png
image of the figure used in the TSC report produced by the NWFSC.  It
expects the SS results read in by \code{\link{SS_output}}.  If MCMC results
are to be plotted, a 'mcmc' list element should be added using the
\code{\link{SSgetMCMC}} function. See the examples below.
