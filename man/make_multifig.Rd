\item{size}{vector of bubbles sizes if making a bubble plot}

\item{cexZ1}{Character expansion (cex) for point associated with value of 1.}

\item{bublegend}{Add legend with example bubble sizes to bubble plots.}

\item{maxsize}{maximum size of bubbles}

\item{do.sqrt}{scale bubbles based on sqrt of size vector. see ?bubble3 for
more info.}

\item{minnbubble}{number of unique x values before adding buffer. see
?bubble3 for more info.}

of total height of plot}

\item{yupper}{upper limit on ymax (applied before addition of ybuffer)}

\item{ymin0}{fix minimum y-value at 0?}

\item{xlas}{label style (las) input for x-axis. Default 0 has horizontal
labels, input 2 would provide vertical lables.}

\item{ylas}{label style (las) input for y-axis. Default NULL has horizontal
labels when all labels have fewer than 6 characters and vertical otherwise.
Input 0 would force vertical labels, and 1 would force horizontal.}

match length of axis1)}

(linepos=2)? A value of linepos = 0 will result in no line.}

\item{type}{type of line/points used for observed values (see 'type' in
?plot for details) on top of a grey polygon. Default is "o" for overplotting
points on lines.}

\item{polygons}{should polygons be added to the
(turning off is required for sex-ratio plot)}

\item{bars}{should the ptsx/ptsy values be bars instead of points
(TRUE/FALSE) NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL}

\item{barwidth}{width of bars in barplot, default method chooses based on
quick and dirty formula also, current method of plot(...type='h') could be
replaced with better approach}

first one on left, all after on right)}

for all plots)}
