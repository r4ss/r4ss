\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create
Numbering of subplots is as follows:
\itemize{
  \item 1  index data by fleet
  \item 2  index data with fit by fleet
  \item 3  observed vs expected index values with smoother
  \item 4  index data by fleet on a log scale (lognormal error only)
  \item 5  index data with fit by fleet on a log scale (lognormal error only)
  \item 6  log(observed) vs log(expected) with smoother (lognormal error only)
  \item 7  time series of time-varying catchability (only if actually time-varying)
  \item 8  catchability vs. vulnerable biomass (if catchability is not constant)
  \item 9  comparison of all indices
  \item 10  index residuals based on total uncertainty
  \item 11  index residuals based on input uncertainty
  \item 12  index deviations (independent of index uncertainty)
}}

\item{plot}{plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{print to PNG files?}

\item{fleets}{optional vector to subset fleets for which plots will be made}

\item{fleetnames}{optional replacement for fleenames used in data file}

\item{smooth}{add smoothed line to plots of observed vs. expected sample
sizes}

\item{add}{add to existing plot (not yet implemented)}

\item{datplot}{make plot of data only?}

\item{labels}{vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{col1}{vector of colors for points in each season for time series plot.
Default is red for single season models and a rainbow using the
rich.colors.short function for multiple seasons.}

\item{col2}{vector of colors for points in each season for obs. vs. exp.
plot.  Default is blue for single season models and a rainbow using the
rich.colors.short function for multiple seasons.}

\item{col3}{color of line showing expected index in time series plot.
Default is blue.}

\item{col4}{color of smoother shown in obs. vs. exp. plots. Default is red.}

\item{pch1}{single value or vector of plotting characters (pch parameter)
for time-series plots of index fit. Default=21.}

\item{pch2}{single value or vector of plotting characters (pch parameter)
for sample size plots of index fit. Default=16.}

\item{cex}{character expansion factor for points showing observed values.
Default=1.}

\item{bg}{Background color for points with pch=21.}

\item{legend}{add a legend to seasonal colors (only for seasonal models)}

\item{legendloc}{add a legend to seasonal colors (default is "topright")}

\item{seasnames}{optional vector of names for each season to replace
defaults if a legend is used}

\item{pwidth}{width of plot}

\item{pheight}{height of plot}

\item{punits}{units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion for plot titles}

\item{mainTitle}{switch which allows the plot title to be left off}

\item{plotdir}{directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{minyr}{First year to show in plot (for zooming in on a subset of
values)}

\item{maxyr}{Last year to show in plot (for zooming in on a subset of
values)}

\item{maximum_ymax_ratio}{Maximum allowed value for ymax (specified
as ratio of y), which overrides any
value of ymax that is greater (default = Inf)}

\item{show_input_uncertainty}{switch controlling whether to add thicker
uncertainty interval lines indicating the input uncertainty relative to
the total uncertainty which may result from estimating a parameter for
extra standard deviations}

\item{verbose}{report progress to R GUI?}

\item{\dots}{Extra arguments to pass to calls to \code{plot}}
