  OFL = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{yrs}{Range of years from which to extract values}

\item{digits}{Vector of number of digits to round to in table for

\item 1 catch
\item 2 spawning output
\item 3 fraction unfished (column is called "depl")
}}

\item{OFL}{Logical indicating whether to include the overfishing limit (OFL)
instead of spawning output in the table. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
