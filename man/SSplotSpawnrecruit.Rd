\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{Vector of which subplots to show.  1=plot without labels,
2=plot with year labels.}

\item{add}{add to existing plot?}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{xlim}{optional control of x range}

\item{ylim}{optional control of y range}

\item{labels}{vector containing x-axis label for models with spawning biomass
in metric tons, y-axis label, and alternative x-axis for models with a fecundity
relationship making spawning output not equal to spawning biomass.}

\item{bioscale}{scaling for spawning biomass. Default = 1.
Previously this was set to
0.5 for single-sex models, and 1.0 for all others, but now single-sex
models are assumed to use the -1 option for Nsexes in the data file so the
scaling is done automatically by SS3.}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written.}

\item{pwidth}{Default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}.}

\item{pheight}{Height of plots printed to png files in units of \code{punits}.
Default is designed to allow two plots per page, with \code{pheight_tall} used
for plots that work best with a taller format and a single plot per page.}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), or "mm" (millimeters).
The default is \code{punits="in"}.}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see
\code{help("png")} in R for details).}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}

\item{colvec}{vector of length 4 with colors for 3 lines and 1 set of points
(where the 4th value for the points is the color of the circle around the
background color provided by \code{ptcol}}

\item{ltyvec}{vector of length 4 with line types for the 3 lines and 1 set
of points, where the points are disconnected (lty=NA) by default}

\item{ptcol}{vector or single value for the color of the points, "default"
will by replaced by a vector of colors of length equal to
\code{nrow(replist[["recruit"]])}}

\item{legend}{Add a legend?}

\item{legendloc}{Location of legend. Either a string like "topleft" or a
vector of two numeric values representing the fraction of the maximum in
the x and y dimensions, respectively. See \code{help("legend")} for more info on
the string options.}

\item{minyr}{minimum year of recruitment deviation to show in plot}

\item{textmindev}{minimum recruitment deviation for label to be added so
only extreme devs are labeled (labels are added to first and last years as
well).  Default=0.7.}

\item{relative}{scale both axes so that B0 and R0 are at 1
to show spawning output and recruitment relative to the equilibrium}

\item{expected}{show line for expected recruitment (stock-recruit curve)}

\item{estimated}{show points for estimated recruitment values
(including deviations)}

\item{bias_adjusted}{show lines for bias adjusted expected recruitment}

\item{show_env}{add line for expected recruitment with environmental
variability}

\item{virg}{add point for equilibrium conditions (x=B0,y=R0)}

\item{init}{add point for initial conditions (x=B1,y=R1), only appears
if this point differs from virgin values}

\item{forecast}{include forecast years in the curve?}

\item{subplot}{Deprecated - use subplots.}
