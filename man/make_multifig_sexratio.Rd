for single plots}

passed to this function via the ... argument.}

\description{
Modified version of \code{\link{make_multifig}} for multi-figure
plots of sex ratio data with crude confidence intervals (+/i 1 se) and
fits from Stock Synthesis output.
}
\details{
The SE of the sex ratio is crude and calculated as
follows. First, assume a multinomial which as MLEs of proportions. Then
use the delta method of the ratio F/M, using the MLE as the expected
values and analytical variances and covariance between F and M. After
some algebra this calculation reduces to: SE(F/M)= sqrt((f/m)^2*(
(1-f)/(f*N) + (1-m)/(m*N) +2/N )). Confidence intervals created from
these should be considered very crude and would not necessarily be
appropriate for future alternative compositional likelihoods.

This function was derived from make_multifig and hence has a lot of
overlap in functionality and arguments.
