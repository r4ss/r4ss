\arguments{
\item{file}{Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.



  See the formal arguments for a possible default filename.}

\item{version}{SS version number. Currently "3.24" or "3.30" are supported,
either as character or numeric values (noting that numeric 3.30  = 3.3). If
`version = NULL` (the default), the version will be looked for on the first
line of the file.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen. The default is \code{verbose = TRUE}.}

\item{echoall}{Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
data as it is read. The default is \code{FALSE}, which turns the
functionality off.}

\item{nseas}{Number of seasons in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file.}

\item{N_areas}{Number of spatial areas in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file.}

\item{Nages}{Oldest age in the model, also known as the accumulator age.
SS always starts age bins in the model with age-zero fish,
so \code{Nages+1} will be the number of ages represented.
This information is not explicitly available in control file.}

\item{Ngenders}{Number of genders in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file.}

\item{Npopbins}{Number of population bins in the model. This information is
not explicitly available in control file and is only
required if length-based maturity vector is directly supplied
in the control file (i.e., maturity option of 6).
Note that the functionality of this option is not yet fully tested.
Please contact the package authors if you are willing to test it out.}

\item{Nfleets}{Number of Fishery + Survey fleets in the model. This
information is not explicitly available in control file 3.30 syntax.}

\item{Nfleet}{Number of Fishery fleets in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file 3.24 syntax.
Only passed to \code{SS_readctl_3.24}.}

\item{Nsurveys}{Number of Survey fleets in the model. This information is
not explicitly available in control file 3.24 syntax.
Only passed to \code{SS_readctl_3.24}.}

\item{N_tag_groups}{Number of tag release groups in the model.
This information is also not explicitly available in control file.}

\item{N_CPUE_obs}{Number of CPUE observations.
Only passed to SS_readctl_3.24.}

\item{catch_mult_fleets}{Integer vector of fleets using the catch multiplier
option. Defaults to NULL and should be left as such if 1) the catch
multiplier option is not used for any fleet or 2) \code{use_datlist = TRUE} and
datlist is specified. Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.}

\item{N_rows_equil_catch}{Integer value of the number of parameter lines to
read for equilibrium catch. Defaults to NULL, which means the function will
attempt to figure out how many lines of equilibrium catch to read from the
control file comments. Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.}

\item{N_dirichlet_parms}{Integer value of the number of Dirichlet-Multinomial
parameters. Defaults to 0. Not used in control file 3.24 syntax.}

\item{use_datlist}{LOGICAL if \code{TRUE}, use datlist to derive parameters which can not be
determined from the control file. See \code{datlist} argument for options for
passing the data file.}

\item{datlist}{List or character. If list, a list returned from
\link{SS_writedat}.
If character, a file name for a dat file to be read in.}

\item{ptype}{LOGICAL if \code{TRUE}, which is the default,
a column will be included in the output indicating parameter type.
Using \code{TRUE} can be useful, but causes problems for \link{SS_writectl},
and therefore is not recommended if you intend to write the list
back out into a file.
Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.}
}
\value{
A list structure where each element is a section of the control file.
}
\description{
Read control file from Stock Synthesis (SS) into R as a list object.
This function acts as a wrapper for version-specific SS_readctl_ functions.
For example, if the control file was written using SS 3.24,
then \code{SS_readctl} will call \link{SS_readctl_3.24}. Input arguments that do not
pertain to the version of your control file can be left at their
default values.
}
\examples{
# Read in the 'simple' example SS model stored in r4ss
# Find the directory
dirsimple <- system.file("extdata", "simple_3.30.13", package = "r4ss")
# Read in the dat file to define the structure of the control file so that
# you don't have to specify things in the function call such as 'Nfleet'
datfilename <- dir(dirsimple, pattern = "data\\\\.ss", full.names = TRUE)
dat <- r4ss::SS_readdat( file = datfilename, verbose = FALSE)
# Read in the control file using a list object for datlist
ctl <- r4ss::SS_readctl(
  file = dir(dirsimple, pattern = "control\\\\.ss", full.names = TRUE),
  verbose = FALSE,
  datlist = dat, use_datlist = TRUE
)
# Read in the control file using a file name for datlist
ctl <- r4ss::SS_readctl(
  file = dir(dirsimple, pattern = "control\\\\.ss", full.names = TRUE),
  verbose = FALSE,
  datlist = datfilename, use_datlist = TRUE
)
}
