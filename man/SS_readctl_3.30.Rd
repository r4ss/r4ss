\arguments{
\item{file}{Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.



  See the formal arguments for a possible default filename.}

\item{verbose}{Should there be verbose output while running the file?
Default=TRUE.}

\item{echoall}{Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
data as it is being read.}

\item{version}{SS version number. Currently only "3.24" or "3.30" are supported,
either as character or numeric values (noting that numeric 3.30  = 3.3).}

\item{nseas}{number of seasons in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{N_areas}{number of spatial areas in the model. Default = 1. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Nages}{oldest age in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Ngenders}{number of genders in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Npopbins}{number of population bins in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file and this information is only required if length based
maturity vector is directly supplied (Maturity option of 6), and not yet tested}

\item{Nfleets}{number of fishery and survey fleets in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Do_AgeKey}{Flag to indicate if 7 additional ageing error parameters to be read
set 1 (but in fact any non zero numeric in R) or TRUE to enable to read them 0 or FALSE (default)
to disable them. This information is not explicitly available in control file, too.}

\item{N_tag_groups}{number of tag release group. Default =NA. This information is not explicitly available
control file. This information is only required if custom tag parameters is enabled (TG_custom=1)}

\item{catch_mult_fleets}{integer vector of fleets using the catch multiplier
option. Defaults to NULL and should be left as such if 1) the catch
multiplier option is not used for any fleets or 2) use_datlist = TRUE and
datlist is specified.}

\item{N_rows_equil_catch}{Integer value of the number of parameter lines to
read for equilibrium catch. Defaults to NULL, which means the function will
attempt to figure out how many lines of equilibrium catch to read from the
control file comments.}

\item{N_dirichlet_parms}{Integer value of the number of Dirichlet multinomial
parameters. Defaults to 0.}

\item{use_datlist}{LOGICAL if TRUE, use datlist to derive parameters which can not be
determined from control file}

\item{datlist}{list or character. If list, should be a list produced from
\code{\link{SS_writedat}}. If character, should be the file name of an
SS data file.}

\description{
Read Stock Synthesis (version 3.30) control file into list object in R.
This function comes with its wrapper function SS_readctl
that calls SS_readctl_3.24  or SS_readctl_3.30 (this function).
