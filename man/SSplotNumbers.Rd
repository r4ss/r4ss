\arguments{
\item{replist}{list created by \code{SSoutput}}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create}

\item{plot}{plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{print to PNG files?}

\item{numbers.unit}{Units for numbers. Default (based on typical Stock Synthesis
setup) is thousands (numbers.unit=1000).}

\item{areas}{optional subset of areas to plot for spatial models}

\item{areanames}{names for areas. Default is to use Area1, Area2,...}

\item{areacols}{vector of colors by area}

\item{pntscalar}{maximum bubble size for bubble plots; each plot scaled
independently based on this maximum size and the values plotted. Often some
plots look better with one value and others with a larger or smaller value.
Default=2.6}

\item{bub.bg}{background color for bubbles
(no control over black border at this time)}

\item{bublegend}{Add legend with example bubble sizes?}

\item{period}{indicator of whether to make plots using numbers at age just
from the beginning ("B") or middle of the year ("M") (new option starting
with SSv3.11)}

\item{add}{add to existing plot? (not yet implemented)}

\item{labels}{vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{pwidth}{width of plot}

\item{pheight}{height of plot}

\item{punits}{units for PNG file}

\item{res}{resolution for PNG file}

\item{ptsize}{point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion for plot titles}

\item{plotdir}{directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{mainTitle}{Logical indicating if a title for the plot should be produced}

\item{verbose}{report progress to R GUI?}

Plot numbers-at-age related data and fits from Stock Synthesis output.
Plots include bubble plots, mean age, equilibrium age composition,
sex-ratio, and ageing imprecision patterns.
