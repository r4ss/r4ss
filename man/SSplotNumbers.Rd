\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create
Numbering of subplots is as follows,
\itemize{
\item 1: Expected numbers at age
\item 2: Mean age in the population
\item 3: Fraction female in numbers at age
\item 4: Equilibrium age distribution
\item 5: Ageing imprecision: SD of observed age (plot using image() formerly
included in this group but now replaced by better distribution plots)
\item 6: Expected numbers at length
\item 7: Mean length in the population
\item 8: Fraction female in numbers at length
\item 9: no plot yet
\item 10: Distribution of observed age at true age by ageing error type
}}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{numbers.unit}{Units for numbers. Default (based on typical Stock Synthesis
setup) is thousands (numbers.unit=1000).}

\item{areas}{optional subset of areas to plot for spatial models}

\item{areanames}{names for areas. Default is to use Area1, Area2,...}

\item{areacols}{vector of colors by area}

\item{pntscalar}{maximum bubble size for bubble plots; each plot scaled
independently based on this maximum size and the values plotted. Often some
plots look better with one value and others with a larger or smaller value.
Default=2.6}

\item{bub.bg}{background color for bubbles
(no control over black border at this time)}

\item{bublegend}{Add legend with example bubble sizes?}

\item{period}{indicator of whether to make plots using numbers at age just
from the beginning ("B") or middle of the year ("M") (new option starting
with SSv3.11)}

\item{meanlines}{add lines for mean age or length on top of bubble plots}

\item{add}{add to existing plot? (not yet implemented)}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels).}

\item{pwidth}{Default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}.}

\item{pheight}{Height of plots printed to png files in units of \code{punits}.
Default is designed to allow two plots per page, with \code{pheight_tall} used
for plots that work best with a taller format and a single plot per page.}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), or "mm" (millimeters).
The default is \code{punits="in"}.}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see
\code{help("png")} in R for details).}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles.
The default is \code{cex.main=1}.}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written.}

\item{mainTitle}{Logical indicating if a title should be included at the top
(not yet implemented for all plots).}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}

Plot numbers-at-age related data and fits from Stock Synthesis output.
Plots include bubble plots, mean age, equilibrium age composition,
sex-ratio, and ageing imprecision patterns.
