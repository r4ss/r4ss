\arguments{
\item{file}{Filename either with full path or relative to working directory.



  See the formal arguments for a possible default filename.}

\item{verbose}{Should there be verbose output while running the file?
Default=TRUE.}

\item{echoall}{Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
data as it is being read.}

\item{version}{SS version number. Currently only "3.24" or "3.30" are supported,
either as character or numeric values (noting that numeric 3.30  = 3.3).}

\item{nseas}{number of seasons in the model. This information is not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{N_areas}{number of spatial areas in the model. Default = 1.
This information is also not explicitly available in control file}

\item{Nages}{oldest age in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Ngenders}{number of genders in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Npopbins}{number of population bins in the model. This information
is also not explicitly available in control file and this information is
only required if length based maturity vector is directly supplied
(Maturity option of 6), and not yet tested}

\item{Nfleet}{number of fisheries in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Nsurveys}{number of survey fleets in the model. This information is also not
explicitly available in control file}

\item{Do_AgeKey}{Flag to indicate if 7 additional ageing error parameters
to be read set 1 (but in fact any non zero numeric in R) or TRUE to enable
to read them 0 or FALSE (default) to disable them.
This information is not explicitly available in control file, too.}

\item{N_tag_groups}{number of tag release group. Default =NA.
This information is not explicitly available control file.
This information is only required if custom tag parameters is enabled (TG_custom=1)}

\item{N_CPUE_obs}{numeric vector of length=Nfleet+Nsurveys containing number of data points of each CPUE time series}

\item{use_datlist}{LOGICAL if TRUE, use datlist to derive parameters which can not be
determined from control file}

\item{datlist}{list or character. if list : produced from SS_writedat
or character : file name of dat file.}

\item{ptype}{include a column in the output indicating parameter type?
(Can be useful, but causes problems for SS_writectl.)}

\description{
Read Stock Synthesis (version 3.24) control file into list object in R.
This function comes with its wrapper function SS_readctl
that calls SS_readctl_3.24 (this function) or SS_readctl_3.30
(to be available in future).
