\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{Vector controlling which subplots to create}

\item{add}{Add to existing plot? (not yet implemented)}

\item{areas}{Optional subset of areas to plot for spatial models}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{type}{Type parameter passed to plot function. Default "l" is lines
only.  Other options include "o" for overplotting points on lines.}

\item{fleetlty}{Vector of line type by fleet}

\item{fleetpch}{Vector of plot character by fleet}

\item{fleetcols}{Vector of colors by fleet}

\item{fleetnames}{Optional replacement for fleenames used in data file,
should include all fleets (not just those with catch)}

\item{lwd}{Line width}

\item{areacols}{Vector of colors by area. Default uses rich.colors by Arni
Magnusson}

\item{areanames}{Names for areas. Default is to use Area1, Area2,...}

\item{minyr}{Optional input for minimum year to show in plots}

\item{maxyr}{Optional input for maximum year to show in plots}

\item{annualcatch}{Include plot of catch aggregated across seasons within
each year}

\item{forecastplot}{Add points from forecast years}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG or PDF files will be written. By default
it will be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{showlegend}{Put legend on plot}

\item{legendloc}{Location of legend (see ?legend for more info)}

\item{order}{Optional input to change the order of fleets in stacked plots.}

\item{xlab}{x-label for all plots}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{catchasnumbers}{Is catch in numbers instead of biomass? Should be set
automatically if set to NULL. If fleets include a mix of biomass and
numbers, then catch plots should be interpreted carefully.}

\item{catchbars}{Show catch by fleet as barplot instead of stacked polygons?
(default=TRUE)}

\item{addmax}{Add a point on the y-axis for the maximum catch (default=TRUE)}

\item{ymax}{Optional input for ymax value (can be used to add or subtract
white space at the top of the figure)}

\item{pwidth}{Width of plot}

\item{pheight}{Height of plot}

\item{punits}{Units for PNG file}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{ptsize}{point size for PNG file}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles}

\item{verbose}{Report progress to R console?}
