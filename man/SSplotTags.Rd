\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create}

\item{latency}{period of tag mixing to exclude from plots (in future could
be included in SS output)}

\item{taggroups}{which tag groups to include in the plots. Default=NULL
causes all groups to be included.}

\item{rows}{number or rows of panels for regular plots}

\item{cols}{number or columns of panels for regular plots}

\item{tagrows}{number or rows of panels for multi-panel plots}

\item{tagcols}{number or columns of panels for multi-panel plots}

\item{plot}{plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{print to PNG files?}

\item{pntscalar}{maximum bubble size for balloon plots; each plot scaled
independently based on this maximum size and the values plotted. Often some
plots look better with one value and others with a larger or smaller value.
Default=2.6}

\item{minnbubble}{minimum number of years below which blank years will be
added to bubble plots to avoid cropping}

\item{pwidth}{default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}. Default=7.}

\item{pheight}{default height width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}. Default=7.}

\item{punits}{units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" or "mm". Default="in".}

\item{ptsize}{point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see
help("png") in R for details). Default=12.}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion parameter for plot titles}

\item{col1}{color for bubbles}

\item{col2}{color for lines with expected values}

\item{col3}{shading color for observations within latency period}

\item{col4}{shading color for observations after latency period}

\item{labels}{vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)}

\item{plotdir}{directory where PNG files will be written. by default it will
be the directory where the model was run.}

\item{verbose}{return updates of function progress to the R GUI?}
