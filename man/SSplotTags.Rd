\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{subplots}{vector controlling which subplots to create}

\item{latency}{period of tag mixing to exclude from plots (in future could
be included in SS output)}

\item{taggroups}{which tag groups to include in the plots. Default=NULL
causes all groups to be included.}

\item{rows}{number or rows of panels for regular plots}

\item{cols}{number or columns of panels for regular plots}

\item{tagrows}{number or rows of panels for multi-panel plots}

\item{tagcols}{number or columns of panels for multi-panel plots}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{pntscalar}{maximum bubble size for balloon plots; each plot scaled
independently based on this maximum size and the values plotted. Often some
plots look better with one value and others with a larger or smaller value.
Default=2.6}

\item{minnbubble}{minimum number of years below which blank years will be
added to bubble plots to avoid cropping}

\item{pwidth}{Default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}.}

\item{pheight}{Height of plots printed to png files in units of \code{punits}.
Default is designed to allow two plots per page, with \code{pheight_tall} used
for plots that work best with a taller format and a single plot per page.}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), or "mm" (millimeters).
The default is \code{punits="in"}.}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see
\code{help("png")} in R for details).}

\item{res}{Resolution of plots printed to files.
The default is \code{res = 300}.}

\item{cex.main}{Character expansion for plot titles.
The default is \code{cex.main=1}.}

\item{col1}{color for bubbles}

\item{col2}{color for lines with expected values}

\item{col3}{shading color for observations within latency period}

\item{col4}{shading color for observations after latency period}

\item{labels}{Vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels).}

\item{plotdir}{Directory where PNG files will be written.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value specifying if output should be printed
to the screen.}
