\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{plot}{Plot sets to be created, see list of plots below.  Use to
specify only those plot sets of interest, e.g., c(1,2,5,10). Plots for data
not available in the model run will automatically be skipped, whether called
or not.
Current grouping of plots is as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item Biology
  \item Selectivity and retention
  \item Timeseries
  \item Recruitment deviations
  \item Recruitment bias adjustment
  \item Spawner-recruit
  \item Catch
  \item SPR
  \item Discards
  \item Mean weight
  \item Indices
  \item Numbers at age
  \item Length comp data
  \item Age comp data
  \item Conditional age-at-length data
  \item Length comp fits
  \item Age comp fits
  \item Conditional age-at-length fits
  \item Francis and Punt conditional age-at-length comp fits
  \item Mean length-at-age and mean weight-at-age
  \item Tags
  \item Yield
  \item Movement
  \item Data range
  \item Parameter distributions
  \item Diagnostic tables
}}

\item{print}{Deprecated input for backward compatibility, now replaced by
\code{png = TRUE/FALSE}.}

\item{pdf}{Send plots to PDF file instead of R GUI?}

\item{png}{Send plots to PNG files instead of R GUI?}

\item{html}{Run \code{\link{SS_html}} on completion? By default has same
value as \code{png}.}

\item{printfolder}{The sub-directory under 'dir' (see below) in which the
PNG files will be located.  The default sub-directory is "plots".
The directory will be created if it doesn\'t exist.
If 'printfolder' is set to "", it is ignored and the PNG files will be located
in the directory specified by 'dir'.}

\item{dir}{The directory in which a PDF file (if requested) will be created
and within which the printfolder sub-directory (see above) will be created
if png=TRUE. By default it will be the same directory that the report file
was read from by the \code{SS_output} function. Alternatives to the default
can be either relative (to the working directory) or absolute paths.
The function will attempt to create the directory it doesn't exist, but it
does not do so recursively.}

\item{fleets}{Either the string "all", or a vector of numerical values, like
c(1,3), listing fleets or surveys for which plots should be made. By
default, plots will be made for all fleets and surveys.  Default="all".}

\item{areas}{Either the string "all", or a vector of numerical values, like
c(1,3), listing areas for which plots should be made in a multi-area model.
By default, plots will be made for all areas (excepting cases where the
function has not yet been updated for multi-area models). Default="all".}

\item{fleetnames}{Either the string "default", or a vector of characters
strings to use for each fleet name. Default="default".}

\item{fleetcols}{Either the string "default", or a vector of colors to use
for each fleet.  Default="default".}

\item{fleetlty}{Vector of line types used for each fleet in some plots.
Default=1.}

\item{fleetpch}{Vector of point types used for each fleet in some plots.
Default=1.}

\item{lwd}{Line width for some plots. Default=1.}

\item{verbose}{Return updates of function progress to the R GUI?  Default=T.}

\item{uncertainty}{Include values in plots showing estimates of uncertainty
(requires positive definite hessian in model?  Default=TRUE.}

\item{forecastplot}{Include forecast years in the timeseries plots and
plots of time-varying quantities? Default=TRUE.}

\item{datplot}{Plot the data by itself? This is useful in document
preparation, but doesn't change across alternative model runs with the same
data, so can be committed to save time once the plots have been created once.
Setting datplot=FALSE is equivalent to leaving off plots 15 and 16.
Default=TRUE.}

\item{Natageplot}{Plot the expected numbers at age bubble plots and mean-age
time series?  Default=T.}

\item{samplesizeplots}{Show sample size plots?  Default=T.}

\item{compresidplots}{Show residuals for composition plots?}

\item{comp.yupper}{Upper limit on ymax for polygon/histogram composition
plots. This avoids scaling all plots to have max=1 if there is a vector
with only a single observed fish in it. Default=0.4.}

\item{sprtarg}{Specify the F/SPR proxy target. Default=0.4.}

\item{btarg}{Target %unfished to be used in plots showing %unfished. May be
omitted by setting to NA.}

\item{minbthresh}{Threshold depletion to be used in plots showing depletion.
May be omitted by setting to NA.}

\item{pntscalar}{This scalar defines the maximum bubble size for bubble
plots. This option is still available but a better choice is to use
bub.scale.pearson and bub.scale.dat, which are allow the same scaling
throughout all plots.}

\item{bub.scale.pearson}{Character expansion (cex) value for a proportion of
1.0 in bubble plot of Pearson residuals. Default=1.5.}

\item{bub.scale.dat}{Character expansion (cex) value for a proportion of 1.0
in bubble plot of composition data. Default=3.}

tagging plots.}

\item{minnbubble}{This defines the minimum number of years below which blank
years will be added to bubble plots to avoid cropping.  Default=8.}

\item{aalyear}{Years to plot multi-panel conditional age-at-length fits for
all length bins; must be in a "c(YYYY,YYYY)" format. Useful for checking the
fit of a dominant year class, critical time period, etc. Default=-1.}

\item{aalbin}{The length bin for which multi-panel plots of the fit to
conditional age-at-length data will be produced for all years.  Useful to
see if growth curves are ok, or to see the information on year classes move
through the conditional data. Default=-1.}

\item{aalresids}{Plot the full set of conditional age-at-length Pearson
residuals? Turn to FALSE if plots are taking too long and you don't want
them.}

\item{maxneff}{The maximum value to include on plots of input and effective
sample size. Occasionally a calculation of effective N blows up to very
large numbers, rendering it impossible to observe the relationship for other
data. Default=5000.}

add growth curves to numbers at length bubble plots.  Default=c().}

input vs. effective sample size? Default=T.}

age-at-length plots (TRUE/FALSE, still in development)}

\item{effNline}{show line for effective sample sizes on top of conditional
age-at-length plots (TRUE/FALSE, still in development)}

\item{showlegend}{Display legends in various plots? Default=T.}

\item{pwidth}{Width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}. Default recently changed from 7 to 6.5.}

\item{pheight}{Height width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}. Default recently changed from 7 to 5.0}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" or "mm". Default="in".}

\item{ptsize}{Point size for plotted text in plots printed to files (see

HTML page (if created) with notes about the model.}

\description{
Creates a user-chosen set of plots, including biological quantities, time
series, and fits to data.  Plots are sent to R GUI, single PDF file, or
multiple PNG files. This is now just a wrapper which calls on separate
functions to make all the plots.
