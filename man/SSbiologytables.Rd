\title{A function to create a table of biology for assessment reporting:
length, weight, \% mature, fecundity, and selectivity}
\usage{
SSbiologytables(
  replist = NULL,
  printfolder = "tables",
  dir = "default",
  fleetnames = "default",
  selexyr = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replist}{A list object created by \code{\link{SS_output}()}.}

\item{printfolder}{The sub-directory under 'dir' (see below) in which the
PNG files will be located.  The default sub-directory is "plots".
The directory will be created if it doesn\'t exist.
If 'printfolder' is set to "", it is ignored and the PNG files will be located
in the directory specified by 'dir'.}

\item{dir}{The directory in which a PDF file (if requested) will be created
and within which the printfolder sub-directory (see above) will be created
if png=TRUE. By default it will be the same directory that the report file
was read from by the \code{SS_output} function. Alternatives to the default
can be either relative (to the working directory) or absolute paths.
The function will attempt to create the directory it doesn't exist, but it
does not do so recursively.}

\item{fleetnames}{Either the string "default", or a vector of characters
strings to use for each fleet name. Default="default".}

\item{selexyr}{The year to summarize selectivity, the default is the final
model yr strings to use for each fleet name. Default="default".}
}
\value{
A csv files containing biology and selectivity tables
}
\description{
Takes the object created by SS_output to create table for reporting
for West Coast groundfish.  Works with Stock Synthesis versions 3.30.12
and later.
