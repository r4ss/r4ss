\item{kind}{indicator of type of plot can be "LEN", "SIZE", "AGE", "cond",
"GSTAGE", "GSTLEN", "L@A", or "W@A".}

\item{sizemethod}{if kind = "SIZE" then this switch chooses which of the
generalized size bin methods will be plotted.}

\item{aalyear}{Years to plot multi-panel conditional age-at-length fits for
all length bins; must be in a "c(YYYY,YYYY)" format. Useful for checking the
fit of a dominant year class, critical time period, etc. Default=-1.}

\item{aalbin}{The length bin for which multi-panel plots of the fit to
conditional age-at-length data will be produced for all years.  Useful to
see if growth curves are ok, or to see the information on year classes move
through the conditional data. Default=-1.}

\item{plot}{Plot to active plot device?}

\item{print}{Print to PNG files?}

\item{fleets}{Either the string "all", or a vector of numerical values, like
c(1,3), listing fleets or surveys to be included in the plot.}

\item{fleetnames}{Optional replacement for fleetnames used in data file.}

\item{sexes}{which sexes to show plots for. Default="all" which will include
males, females, and unsexed. This option is not fully implemented for all
plots.}

\item{yupper}{upper limit on ymax for polygon/histogram composition plots}

\item{datonly}{make plots of data without fits?}

\item{samplesizeplots}{make sample size plots?}

\item{compresidplots}{make plots of residuals for fit to composition data?}

into different plots for each market category (retained, discarded)?}

age-at-length plots (TRUE/FALSE, still in development)}

age-at-length plots (TRUE/FALSE, still in development)}

\item{minnbubble}{number of unique x values before adding buffer. see
?bubble3 for more info.}

\item{pntscalar}{This scalar defines the maximum bubble size for bubble
plots. This option is still available but a better choice is to use cexZ1
which allow the same scaling throughout all plots.}

\item{scalebubbles}{scale data-only bubbles by sample size, not just
proportion within sample? Default=FALSE.}

\item{cexZ1}{Character expansion (cex) for point associated with value of 1.}

\item{bublegend}{Add legend with example bubble sizes to bubble plots.}

\item{colvec}{Vector of length 3 with colors for females, males, unsexed fish}

\item{linescol}{Color for lines on top of polygons}

\item{xlas}{label style (las) input for x-axis. Default 0 has horizontal
labels, input 2 would provide vertical labels.}

\item{ylas}{label style (las) input for y-axis. Default NULL has horizontal
labels when all labels have fewer than 6 characters and vertical otherwise.
Input 0 would force vertical labels, and 1 would force horizontal.}

\item{axis1}{optional position of bottom axis values}

\item{axis2}{optional position of left size axis values}

\item{axis1labs}{optional vector of labels for axis1 (either NULL or needs to
match length of axis1)}

size frequency method}

\item{blue}{What color to use for males in bubble plots (default is slightly
transparent blue)}

\item{pwidth}{Default width of plots printed to files in units of
\code{punits}.}

\item{pheight}{Height of plots printed to png files in units of \code{punits}.
Default is designed to allow two plots per page, with \code{pheight_tall} used
for plots that work best with a taller format and a single plot per page.}

\item{punits}{Units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px"
(pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" (centimeters), or "mm" (millimeters).
The default is \code{punits="in"}.}

age-at-length plots.}

\item{andrerows}{Number of rows of Andre's conditional age-at-length plots
within each page. Default=3.}

number of years of data}

\item{fixdims2}{fix the dimensions at maxrows by maxcols in aggregate plots
or resize based on number of fleets}

sample size. Occasionally a calculation of effective N blows up to very
