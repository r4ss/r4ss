Stock Synthesis is a fisheries stock assessment model written in ADMB by
Rick Methot. The Stock Synthesis software and many other associated
materials are available in the [Stock Synthesis GitHub
repository](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code) and other
repositories under the [nmfs-ost
organization](https://github.com/nmfs-ost). The r4ss package is a
collection of R functions for interacting with Stock Synthesis. It is
based on the original work of Ian Stewart begun around 2005 and released
as an open source R package in 2009. The package has a long list of
authors and has benefited from a large community of users making
suggestions and reporting issues.

*This code comes with no warranty or guarantee of accuracy. It merely
represents an ongoing attempt to integrate output plotting, statistics
and diagnostics. It is absolutely necessary that prior to use with a new
application, the user checks the output manually to verify that there
are no plotting or statistical bugs which could incorrectly represent
the output files being analyzed.*

## Installation

There is a CRAN version of r4ss but it is out of date (last updated in
May 2022). Installing directly from github via either the {pak} package
or {remotes} will get the most recent main branch which should always
work with the latest version of Stock Synthesis (as well as many older
versions). Sometimes one or the other of these installations doesn’t
work, in that case find where your R packages are stored using
[`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html), navigate there
and manually delete the previously downloaded {r4ss} package. Then,
restart R and use the other installation method to download {r4ss}. This
manual deletion approach may also for dependent packages if updating
them is causing errors in the installation of r4ss.

``` s
# option 1: install via {pak}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("r4ss/r4ss")

# option 2: install via {remotes}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r4ss/r4ss")
```

Once you have installed the r4ss package, it can be loaded using:

``` s
library(r4ss)
```

To get notifications about r4ss, you can watch this GitHub project or
follow issues and discussions in the [Stock Synthesis GitHub
repository](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code). Additionally,
you can follow messages on the [forums on Stock Synthesis
VLab](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/public-forums), however,
most communications about Stock Synthesis are distributed via GitHub
rather than VLab. Note that to subscribe to the Stock Synthesis VLab
forums, an account is required, but those without an account may still
view and post forum messages.

The r4ss website <https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss> includes a vignette
explaining the use of common functions and [example r4ss
plots](https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/BigSkate) from a 2019 Big Skate stock
assessment for the U.S. West Coast (which used SS version 3.30.13.02 and
r4ss version 1.39.0).
