#' Read control file from SS
#'
#' Read control file from Stock Synthesis (SS) into R as a list object.
#' This function acts as a wrapper for version-specific SS_readctl_ functions.
#' For example, if the control file was written using SS 3.24,
#' then `SS_readctl` will call [SS_readctl_3.24]. Input arguments that do not
#' pertain to the version of your control file can be left at their
#' default values.
#'
#' @template file
#' @template version
#' @template verbose
#' @param echoall Debugging tool (not fully implemented) of echoing blocks of
#' data as it is read. The default is `FALSE`, which turns the
#' functionality off.
#' @param nseas Number of seasons in the model. This information is not
#'  explicitly available in control file.
#' @param N_areas Number of spatial areas in the model. This information is not
#'  explicitly available in control file.
#' @param Nages Oldest age in the model, also known as the accumulator age.
#'  SS always starts age bins in the model with age-zero fish,
#'  so `Nages+1` will be the number of ages represented.
#'  This information is not explicitly available in control file.
#' @param Ngenders Number of genders in the model. This information is not
#'  explicitly available in control file.
#' @param Npopbins Number of population bins in the model. This information is
#'  not explicitly available in control file and is only
#'  required if length-based maturity vector is directly supplied
#'  in the control file (i.e., maturity option of 6).
#'  Note that the functionality of this option is not yet fully tested.
#'  Please contact the package authors if you are willing to test it out.
#' @param Nfleets Number of Fishery + Survey fleets in the model. This
#'  information is not explicitly available in control file 3.30 syntax.
#' @param Nfleet Number of Fishery fleets in the model. This information is not
#'  explicitly available in control file 3.24 syntax.
#'  Only passed to `SS_readctl_3.24`.
#' @param Nsurveys Number of Survey fleets in the model. This information is
#'  not explicitly available in control file 3.24 syntax.
#'  Only passed to `SS_readctl_3.24`.
#' @param N_tag_groups Number of tag release groups in the model.
#' This information is also not explicitly available in control file.
#' @param N_CPUE_obs Number of CPUE observations.
#'  Only passed to SS_readctl_3.24.
#' @param use_datlist LOGICAL if `TRUE`, use datlist to derive parameters which can not be
#'  determined from the control file. See `datlist` argument for options for
#'  passing the data file.
#' @param catch_mult_fleets Integer vector of fleets using the catch multiplier
#'   option. Defaults to NULL and should be left as such if 1) the catch
#'   multiplier option is not used for any fleet or 2) `use_datlist = TRUE` and
#'   datlist is specified. Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.
#' @param N_rows_equil_catch Integer value of the number of parameter lines to
#'  read for equilibrium catch. Defaults to NULL, which means the function will
#'  attempt to figure out how many lines of equilibrium catch to read from the
#'  control file comments. Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.
#' @param N_dirichlet_parms Integer value of the number of Dirichlet-Multinomial
#' parameters. Defaults to 0. Not used in control file 3.24 syntax.
#' @param datlist List or character. If list, a list returned from
#'  [r4ss::SS_writedat].
#'  If character, a file name for a dat file to be read in.
#' @param ptype LOGICAL if `TRUE`, which is the default,
#'  a column will be included in the output indicating parameter type.
#'  Using `TRUE` can be useful, but causes problems for [SS_writectl],
#'  and therefore is not recommended if you intend to write the list
#'  back out into a file.
#'  Used only in control file 3.30 syntax.
#' @author Ian G. Taylor, Yukio Takeuchi, Neil L. Klaer

#' @return
#' A list structure where each element is a section of the control file.
#' @seealso
#' See the following for version-specific SS_readctl functions:
#' `r ls("package:r4ss", pattern = "SS_readctl_")`.
#' The returned list structure can be written back to the disk using
