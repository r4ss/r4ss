#' Replace dollar sign operator in a file
#'
#' The dollar sign is convienent to write, but allows for partial matching,
#' which we don't often want. This function takes a file and changes all dollar
#' signs to double brackets with names in quotations instead. Note that this
#' function will incorrectly convert text that includesnames in backticks that
#' include a dollar sign (for example, test$`my$name` will not convert correctly).
#' Note also that if a dollar sign is within a text string, it will also not 
#' convert correctly (for example, "See test$name" would become 
#' "See test[["name"]]", which is not parsable R code. Luckily, this is easily 
#' discoverable by loading or sourcing the function.)
#' @template file
#' @param out_file The name or path of a new file to write to. This is by
#'  default the same as the original file. Set to NULL to avoid writing a new
#'  file.
#' @param allow_recursive Should dollar sign references of list in list be
#'  replaced? If this is FALSE, then only the first reference will be replaced.
#'  For example, F$first$second would become F[["first"]]$second when
#'  alow_recursive is FALSE, but would become F[["first"]][["second"]] if TRUE.
#' @param max_loops How many times should dollar signs be looked for
#'  recursively, if allow_recursive is TRUE? Defaults to 5. This is meant to
#'  prevent an infinite loop in case the function does not work properly.
#' @return A character vector of the modified text. As a side effect, produces
#'  a text file out_file that was written out from R using writeLines().
