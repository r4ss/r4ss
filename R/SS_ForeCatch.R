##' Create table of fixed forecast catches
##'
##' Processing values of dead or retained biomass from timeseries output
##' to fit the format required at the bottom of the forecast file.
##' This can be used to map the catches resulting from forecasting with a particular
##' harvest control rule into a model representing a different state of nature.
##' This is a common task for US west coast groundfish but might be useful elsewhere.
##'
##' @template replist
##' @param yrs Range of years in which to fill in forecast catches from timeseries
##' @param average Use average catch over a range of years for forecast
##' (as opposed to using forecast based on control rule)
##' @param avg.yrs Range of years to average over
##' @param total Either single value or vector of annual total forecast catch
##' used to scale values (especially if values are from average catches).
##' For west coast groundfish, total might be ACL for next 2 forecast years
##' @param digits Number of digits to round to in table
##' @param dead TRUE/FALSE switch to choose dead catch instead of retained catch.
##' @param zeros Include entries with zero catch (TRUE/FALSE)
