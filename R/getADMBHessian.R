##' Read admodel.hes file
##'
##' This function reads in all of the information contained in the
##' admodel.hes file. Some of this is needed for relaxing the
##' covariance matrix, and others just need to be recorded and
##' rewritten to file so ADMB "sees" what it's expecting.
##' @param File Directory in which .hes file is located.
##' @param FileName Name of .hes file.
##' @return A list with elements num.pars, hes, hybrid_bounded_flag, and scale.
