#' Find location of executable within path or specified directory
#'
#' Check that the Stock Synthesis executable name provided in `exe`,
#' an input argument to numerous `r4ss` functions is available in the
#' location specified by `dir` or in the path.
#'
#' @template exe
#' @param dir The directory where `exe` is located (if not in path).
#' Defaults to `getwd()` but can be an absolute path, a path relative to
#' the working directory or a path relative to a directory that's in the
#' PATH. Can also be a vector of directories.
#' @template verbose
#' @author Kelli F. Johnson, Ian G. Taylor
#' @return A list containing `$exe` and `$path`.
#' `$exe` is the cleaned version of the `exe` file name input. Windows
#' systems will include
#' ".exe" in the returned value. On Linux and Mac systems, the returned
#' `$exe` will include "./" if the executable was found in the specified
#' directory `dir`. This will be a single character string, unlike `$path` which
#' will be a vector if the input `dir` is a vector.
#' The `$path` element of the list includes the normalized path (or
#' paths if `dir` is a vector) where the executable was found. If `dir`
#' is a vector and the executable is missing from a subset of those
#' directories, NA is returned for those elements of `$path`.
#' If the specified `exe` input is not found in any of the `dir` input
#' values nor in the PATH, then the function stops with an error.

#' @description The `check_exe()` function first checks the specified
#' directory `dir` for the specified SS3 executable name and returns the
#' file's location if found. If it is not found in the specified
#' directory, then it checks the PATH. Linux systems may have an
#' existing executable utility `/usr/sbin/ss` in the path. If `exe =
#' "ss"` and this file is found by `check_exe()``, it will be ignored
#' based on the smaller file size relative to the SS3 executable. Linux
#' users who want to use the workflow of having SS3 in their PATH should
#' name the SS3 file something besides `ss`, such as `ss3` or
#' `ss_linux`.
