#' Read in a weight-at-age data file as a data frame
#'
#' @template file
#' @template verbose
#' @export
#' @return Returns a data frame with a variable number of columns based on the
#' number of ages that are included in the file. Though, the first columns
#' will always be `year`, `seas`, `sex`, `bio_pattern`, `birthSeas`, and `fleet`.
#' The seventh column will be age zero.
#' The last or next to last column will be the maximum age included
#' in the weight-at-age data. For Stock Synthesis versions 3.30 and greater,
#' the last column will be a column of comments.
#'
#' `NULL` is returned if `file` does not exist or if the file does exist but
#' it is empty. This behavior is different than other `SS_read*` functions that
#' error if either of the previous checks are `TRUE`. Thus, a complicated check
#' involving [tryCatch()] is used around [readLines()] to allow for returning
#' `NULL` rather than `stop()`. Additionally, this check accommodates a URL
#' for `file`.
