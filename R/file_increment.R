#' Rename key Stock Synthesis output files by adding integer value
#'
#' Rename files found with `pattern` by adding `i` to their
#' name before the extension.
#'
#' @details
#' The `.par` file, which is the only file extension searched for
#' with the default entry that does not end in `.sso`, is
#' modified differently.`_i.sso` is added to the file name.
#' @param path Directory where model files are located.
#' @param i An integer value to append to the file name before the
#' `.sso` extension.
#' @template verbose
#' @param pattern A character value specifying the file names to search
#' for in `getwd()`.
#' @author Kelli F. Johnson
#' @returns Invisibly returns a vector of logical values specifying
#' whether or not the file was successfully renamed.
