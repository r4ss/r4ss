Stock Synthesis is a fisheries stock assessment model written in ADMB by
Rick Methot. The Stock Synthesis software and many other associated
materials are available on the NOAA Virtual Laboratory at
[https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/home](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/home).
The r4ss package is a collection of R functions for interacting with
Stock Synthesis. It is based on the original work of Ian Stewart begun
around 2005 and released as an open source R package in 2009. The
package has a long list of authors and has benefited from a large
community of users making suggestions and reporting issues.

*This code comes with no warranty or guarantee of accuracy. It merely
represents an ongoing attempt to integrate output plotting, statistics
and diagnostics. It is absolutely necessary that prior to use with a new
application, the user checks the output manually to verify that there
are no plotting or statistical bugs which could incorrectly represent
the output files being analyzed.*

## Installation

The CRAN version of r4ss was updated on 26 May 2022 and is available
via

```S
install.packages("r4ss")
```

In general, installing directly from github will get a newer version
than what's on CRAN. The github version also contains a vignette and
additional model files that were too large for CRAN:

```S
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("r4ss/r4ss")
```

Once you have installed the r4ss package, it can be loaded using:

```S
library(r4ss)
```

To get notifications about r4ss, you can watch this GitHub project or
follow messages on the [forums on Stock Synthesis
VLab](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/public-forums). Note
that to subscribe to the Stock Synthesis VLab forums, an account is
required, but those without an account may still view and post forum
messages.

A basic vignette (not available in the CRAN version) can be viewed at
<https://r4ss.github.io/r4ss/vignettes/r4ss-intro-vignette.html>.
