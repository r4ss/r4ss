# r4ss 1.46.1 (29 July 2022)
* Major revamp of all functions that run the Stock Synthesis executable
  https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/pull/722
  * Functions that run the executable have been renamed:
    https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/issues/723:
    * `run_SS_models()` -> `run()` (now has defaults which allow you to
      simply call `run()` in the current working directory as well as
      and better support for having the Stock Synthesis executable in
      your path)
    * `SS_profile()` -> `profile()`
    * `SS_doRetro()` -> `retro()`
    * `SS_RunJitter()` -> `jitter()`
    * `SS_tune_comps()` -> `tune_comps()`
  * Functions have more consistent inputs (e.g., always `dir` instead of
    `mydir`, `File`, or `masterdir`, and now defaulting to the current
    working directory) 
  * Input `show_in_console = FALSE` can be used with all these functions
    and will pipe output to a text file keeping R console cleaner while
    models run
* Deprecates functions that relate to 3.24 models, like
  `SS_readdat_3.24()` (although `SS_output()` is still compatible back
  to version 3.24) https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/pull/718 
* Introduces new "simple_small" example model but removes older
  examples, reducing total package size https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/pull/700
* Uses new columns names in BIOLOGY output https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss/pull/711
* Numerous bug fixes
* Adds dependency on 'tidyr'
* Removes never-completed function `SSbootstrap()`
