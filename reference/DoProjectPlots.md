# Deprecated function to make plots from Andre Punt's Rebuilder program.

The function has been moved to
https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/rebuilder. This function was rarely
used because it was specific to U.S. west coast groundfish stocks that
were overfished and in a rebuilding plan. Therefore there's no need to
have it available to all r4ss users.

## Usage

``` r
DoProjectPlots(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Any arguments associated with the now-deprecated functions.
